  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>I am a 33 year old native of Decatur, AL. Currently working in Law Enforcement, but felt like branching out my skillset.<br>
    Coding seemed to be a fun little hobby to tinker with during my free time.</p>
  <p>I've tried a few different coding websites without much in the way of success. They either jumped in a bit too quickly, or failed to explain things cleary enough for me to understand.<br>
    Currently working through a Udemy course.</p>
